### objectif of tp3 
in this tp we have created our first classes without bluej ,we created 2 classes.  
#### Rectangle : a class wich controlls rectangles and make different opertaions with the this class.  
this class has one constructor:  
* Rectangle(double w,double h):the constructor has 2 parametres the width and the height of the rectangle

the methodes of this classe are :  
* getwidth() : return the width of the rectangle.
* getheight(): return the height of the rectangle.  
* area(): return the area of the rectangle .
* perimeter() : return the perimiter the perimiter of the rectangle.  
* isSquare() : return true if the rectangle is a square else  it return false.  
* equals(object o) : verify if 2 rectangles are equals .
* toString(): return a string desribing the rectangle.  
at the end we created a methode main in which we created 2 rectangle and we used the methodes of the classe and printed some results. to run this methode we have to introduce 4 double parametre at the execution

#### Complexe : a class which modelise and controll complex numbers.  
this classe has one constructeur:  
* Complex(double r,double i):the constructor has 2 parametres the real part of the number and the imaginary part of the number  

the methodes of this class are:
* isReal():return true if the number is real else false.
* realPart():return the real part of the complex number.
* imaginaryPart():return the imaginary part of the complex number. 
* module():return the module of the number after caulculating it.
* conjugue():retun the conjuguate of the complex number who called this methode without modying it.
* add(Complex c):realise the addition of two complex number and return the result of the addition without modifying the two numbers.
* multiplicate(Complex c):realise the multiplication of two complex number and return the result of the miltiplication without modifying the two numbers.
* equals(object o): verify the equality of two complex number
* toString : return a String describing the complex number  
at the end we created a class main in which we created two complex numbers and we used the methodes in our programme .to run this methode we have to introduce 4 double parametre at the execution
